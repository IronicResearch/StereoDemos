Original GLUT demos from GLUT SDK posted at http://www.opengl.org
Modified GLUT demos from SciTech MGL SDK posted at http://www.scitechsoft.com


Stereo Parallax commands for all Demos:
        "+" key increases viewpoint separation
        "-" key decreases viewpoint separation
        "*" key increases image shift adjustment
        "/" key decreases image shift adjustment


Gears.exe = Rotating Gears:
        ARROW keys rotate view axes
        "s" key toggles stereo/mono view

Logo.exe = Animated OpenGL Logo:
        SPACE key restarts animation
        "s" key toggles stereo/mono view

Morph2.exe = Morphing Polyhedron:
        SPACE key pauses animation
        "s" key toggles stereo/mono view

Skyfly.exe = SkyFly flight sim illustrated in OpenGL "Red Book":
        mouse left-click accelerates
        mouse right-click decelerates
        mouse movement while dragging rotates view
        SPACE key toggles navigation from mouse to ARROW keys
        "f" key toggles fogging on/off
        "s" key toggles stereo/mono view

Steam.exe = Steam Engine Piston:
        ARROW keys rotate view axes
        "s" key toggles shading on/off
        "t" key toggles texture mapping on/off
        "o" key toggles opacity (transparency) on/off

Test.exe = Stereo Display Mode Test:
        Overlapping red and blue rectangles should appear purple


Note that these GLUT demos use a recompiled version GLUT32.DLL which will popup Windows-style message boxes in case of error. A "pixel format" error message would most likely indicate that stereo display support has not been properly enabled. Check the SciTech GLDirect control panel for OpenGL Stereo configuration.
